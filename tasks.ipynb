    "> For example, starting with the value 10, which is an even number, we divide it by 2 to get 5. Then 5 is an odd number so, we multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 16. Then we repeatedly divide by 2 to get 8, 4, 2, 1. **Once we are at 1, we go back to 4 and get stuck in the repeating sequence 4, 2, 1 as we suspected.**\n",
